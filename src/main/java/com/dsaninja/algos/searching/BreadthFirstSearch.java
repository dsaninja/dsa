/**
 * Breadth First Traversal (or Search) for a graph is similar to Breadth First
 * Traversal of a tree. The only catch here is, unlike trees, graphs may contain
 * cycles, so we may come to the same node again. To avoid processing a node more
 * than once, we use a boolean visited array.
 * <p>
 * Extra memory, as a queue, is needed to keep track of the vertices
 * that were encountered but not yet explored.
 *
 * <h1>Complexity</h1>
 * <p>
 * The time complexity of algorithm actually depends on the data structure being used to represent the graph:
 * <ol>
 * If the graph is represented as an adjacency matrix (a V x V array):
 *  <li>For each node, we will have to traverse an entire row of length V in the matrix to discover all its outgoing edges.</li>
 *  <li> Note that each row in an adjacency matrix corresponds to a node in the graph, and that row stores information about edges emerging from
 *  the node. Hence, the time complexity of BFS in this case is O(V * V) = O(V^2)</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <ol>
 * If the graph is represented as adjacency list:
 * <li>Here, each node maintains a list of all its adjacent edges. Letâ€™s assume that there are V number of nodes and E number of edges in the graph
 * .</li>
 * <li>For each node, we discover all its neighbors by traversing its adjacency list just once in linear time.</li>
 * <li>For a directed graph, the sum of the sizes of the adjacency lists of all the nodes is E. So, the time complexity in this case is O(V) + O(E)
 * = O(V + E).</li>
 * <li>For an undirected graph, each edge appears twice. Once in the adjacency list of either end of the edge. The time complexity for this case
 * will be O(V) + O (2E) ~ O(V + E).</li>
 *
 * </ol>
